      Stackbit redefines the way websites are being built. Stackbit empowers developers to build websites the way they like, using the tools they
      love and programming patterns they are accustomed to. However, the technology selected by developers does not limit content creators in WYSIWYG
      editing capabilities.

      I'm working on different parts of the product, mostly focused on the Studio product - an app which allows users to edit their sites in WYSIWYG and
      seeing changes in live preview.

      Acquired by Netlify.

  Programming is big part of me, that's why it is my work and, in the same time, my hobby. Self-learner, started from the scratch and got
  everything by my own.


  Love to travel, when I'm seeing the world it inspires me. Usually read technical books, but also love to dive into fantasies, like the
  world of Middle-earth or Forgotten realms or Tamriel - but the last comes from the The Elder Scrolls games.


  Pretty heavy "pro" gamer, but in a past. Still frequently playing PC/PS games, but not having as much time as before. Love to think
  if it wasn't IT - would definitely become cybersport player.


  Like to drive anything has wheels - bicycles, cars, small planes.
